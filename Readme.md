# üéØ One View, Many Worlds: Single-Image to 3D Object Meets Generative Domain Randomization for One-Shot 6D Pose Estimation

## üìÑ Abstract

We introduce one-2-3-pose, a fast and accurate pipeline for 6D pose and scale estimation from a single image. Given just one picture of an object, our system can build its 3D model from scratch and then determine its precise 3D position, orientation, and size.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Quick Setup Using `setup.sh`

To streamline the setup process, we provide a `setup.sh` script that automates all installation steps. Follow these instructions to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before running the `setup.sh` script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.11+
- Conda (recommended)
- Basic build tools (`git`, `make`, `cmake`, etc.)

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GZWSAMA/One23Pose.git
   cd One23Pose
   ```

2. **Make the `setup.sh` script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. **Run the `setup.sh` script:**

   It is recommended to run this script within a fresh conda environment. Here's how you can create and activate a new environment before running the script:

   ```bash
   conda create -n one23pose python=3.11 -y
   conda activate one23pose
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The script will handle:
   - Installing PyTorch with CUDA support.
   - Installing required dependencies.
   - Cloning and installing external extensions.
   - Building F-Pose.
   - Installing local packages in editable mode.
   - Downloading pretrained weights.
   - Patching the transformers library.

4. **Verify the setup:**

   After running the script, verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and the necessary files are downloaded.

## üìù Notes

- This project depends on multiple third-party libraries and modules. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `conda`) for development.
- If you encounter any installation issues, refer to the official documentation of each sub-module or open an issue.
- This README will be continuously updated and improved as the project evolves.
